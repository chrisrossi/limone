Changelog for Limone
--------------------

0.1a3 (2011-08-09)
++++++++++++++++++

- Make sure that when a property of a _MappingNode is set that __setattr__ is
  used to set the underlying attribute. This is done for the benefit of
  extensions that rely on __setattr__ being called, such as `limone_zodb`.

0.1a2 (2011-07-16)
++++++++++++++++++

- Refactored some internals to allow extension by packages that might want to
  use Limone as a base.  See `limone_zodb` as an example.

0.1a1 (2011-07-07)
++++++++++++++++++

- First alpha release.
