Changelog for Limone
--------------------

Unreleased

0.1a4 (2011-08-11)
++++++++++++++++++

- Make sure that a property of a _MappingNode is set that __setattr__ is used
  to set the underlying attribute.  This is done for the benefit of extensions
  that rely on __setattr__ being called, such as `limone_zodb`.

- Use an overridable property factory for generating property descriptors for
  attributes of content types.

0.1a3 (2011-08-09)
++++++++++++++++++

- Refactor such that every node contained by a content object has a reference
  to the content object.

0.1a2 (2011-07-16)
++++++++++++++++++

- Refactored some internals to allow extension by packages that might want to
  use Limone as a base.  See `limone_zodb` as an example.

0.1a1 (2011-07-07)
++++++++++++++++++

- First alpha release.
